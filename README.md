The code features some standalone modules you can run separately directly from the `DesktopLauncher`, those are later to be replaced by corresponding `Module` classes.
It also features some modules not taken into account by the `ModuleHandler` module initialization, the goal is to be able to cycle through the modules with a menu and
"left" and "right" buttons
